### Image Segmentation Using U-Net

#### Technologies Used
1. Python
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. U-Net Architecture

#### Techniques
U-Net is a popular architecture for image segmentation tasks. The dataset used consisted of medical images where the goal was to identify specific regions of interest. The U-Net model was trained with data augmentation to enhance the model's robustness. Performance was evaluated using the Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics.

#### Learning Outcomes
1. Learned the details of convolutional layers and the role of skip connections in U-Net.
2. Understood the importance of data augmentation for improving model performance on limited datasets.
3. Explored performance metrics specific to image segmentation tasks, such as IoU and Dice coefficient.

#### Results
1. Dice Coefficient: 0.87
2. IoU: 0.83
